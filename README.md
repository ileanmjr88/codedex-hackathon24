# Codedex Mini-Hackathon 2024

As a person that saw the internet grow from the early 90's I did my absolute best to recreate parts of my personal website in 90's style.

From having the resolution be emulated to be 800x600 and having it slightly off centered to the left if you were the lucky one to have a larger screen especially as we entered the early 2000's. I also recalled having seen lots of places have visitors have the ability to sign a guestbook. It was almost like the internet stardard for blogs to have a tiled background or a gray background.
