# Codedex Mini-Hackathon 2024

As someone who witnessed the growth of the internet from the early 90s, I have done my best to recreate parts of my personal website in a 90s style.

The resolution is emulated to be 800x600, slightly off-centered to the left, reminiscent of the experience for those with larger screens as we entered the early 2000s. I also included a guestbook feature, which was a common element on many websites back then. Additionally, many blogs had either a tiled background or a gray background.
