Since my layoff in early September, I've been navigating the tech landscape in Houston and documenting my observations along the way. Surprisingly, Houston offers much more in technology than I initially expected. While it’s known globally as the Oil & Gas capital, Houston has a growing tech scene where companies and events span multiple industries, not just energy.

In my search, I found the Ion District, a collaborative tech hub that hosts various events almost daily. To get started with networking, I’ve attended a few groups, mostly at the Ion and the Improving offices—a software development and IT consultancy with an inviting space for meetups and community events.

In my effort to start networking, I have attended three different groups. Two are hosted at the Ion, and the other is at the Improving offices. Improving is a software development and IT consultant company hosting several Meetup groups related to software. They have a dedicated room for these events with free drinks and snacks. This is a step in the right direction to foster innovation and, more importantly, have the innovation stay in Houston.

## Events

Given my background in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the groups I have attended reflect areas of interest and things I have done in my career. The events are very inclusive, which is excellent. It shows how diverse Houston is and that it accepts everyone as they are.

### Code & Coffee

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/houston-code-and-coffee/)   
Held: Monthly on Sunday

This is the first group I attended. I can be social, but getting out of my comfort zone takes effort. I did get out of my comfort because the first meeting was about 90% first-time attendees. The meetings usually start with everyone signing in and getting a name tag and some time for mingling. Once Eric, the host, gives a short introduction along with the Improving host, which offers a quick rundown about the company (which, in reality, is about a minute, which is brief, in my opinion). The introduction ends with a group circle where we introduce ourselves to each other. After that, it is more mingling; you can work on a project together if someone has one. 

This group is very inclusive, both in its diversity and in welcoming new learners and seasoned veterans. There is even a professor who attends and sets up an area of the room where learners can ask questions and work through it together. So bring your computer if that is the case. 

### Houston Robotics Group

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/houstonroboticsgroup/)  
Held: Weekly on Saturday

This group is more of a working session, and people come to work on robotics projects. You walk in and meet as many people as you like. If you still need to get a robot project, no pro; the event organizers lend you a kit and set up the beginners to learn to assemble it. They also lend you an Arduino and show beginners how to code the LED blinking light. All levels of robotic enthusiasts are welcome. While yes, there are season roboticists, most of the attendees are University students working on improving skills and knowledge who are happy to help. 

Typically, the attendees pick a restaurant for dinner after the meeting, a short ride on the Metro Rail. 

### Cup of Joey

[Website](https://www.cupofjoey.org/)  
Held: Weekly on Friday

This is the only general or business networking event I have attended. You sign in and get a name sticker, but you do not write down your name; you write down your purpose in life. Recommendation: Have something in mind before attending. I did not know and was thrown off for a few minutes while I thought of something. Overall, it is just a networking event. Having your purpose on the name tag makes it easier to strike up conversations. You will see the diversity of Houston in this group the most, from the different industries and people of all ages connecting and finding discussions. 

## Ending Notes

While these are the few I picked to attend, there are more software meet-ups in Houston. Most might be in the Improving offices, and you can find them via the Meetup app.
